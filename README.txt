Shoveler (a pun of a Japanese word "shaberu" for to speak) is a
lightweight Japanese speech synthesizer. It is intended to be used in
an embedded application with a small footprint and less powerful CPU
performance. Written entirely in Python, it is also aimed to be easy
to understand.

TODO:
  1. Tone/inflection support.
  2. Pitch/speed adjustment.
  3. Rewrite in C and/or ActionScript/JavaScript.

Yay!
